This project demonstrates the concept of multithreading in Java by simulating a robot performing a task. The robot operates in parallel threads, each performing a specific task or part of the task concurrently. 
The main goal of this project is to showcase how threads can be used to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, improving efficiency and responsiveness.
