This project demonstrates the concept of multithreading in Java by simulating a robot performing a task. The robot operates in parallel threads, each performing a specific task or part of the task concurrently. 
The main goal of this project is to showcase how threads can be used to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, improving efficiency and responsiveness.
Key Concepts:
Threads: The robot's tasks are divided into multiple threads, each of which runs concurrently, simulating real-world robots that can perform multiple actions at the same time.
Synchronization: The program may include synchronization techniques to ensure that shared resources are accessed safely and prevent data corruption or inconsistencies.
Task Management: The robot can be assigned different tasks (such as moving, picking up objects, or performing calculations), and each of these tasks is handled by a separate thread.

The first folder called robotTask contains the program using extends, and the second folder robotTask2 contains the program using implements.
